* List of animal names [from a language learning website](https://www.germanpod101.com/blog/2021/11/17/german-animal-words/)  called 'German Animal Names: The Ultimate Vocabulary List' containing 84 basic animal names. This was manually reconciled with wikidata entities. 

* List of wikidata 'taxon common names'([P1843](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P1843))(de) for wikidata 'taxons'([Q16521](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16521)) of rank([P105](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P105)) species([Q7432](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7432)). This was automatically categorized into plants/animals/fungi by recursively checking P171 'parent_taxon'.

* List of wikidata 'organisms known by a particular common name'([Q55983715](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q55983715)). This was filtered from homonyms and categorized into plants/animals/fungi semi-manually.
